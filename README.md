## Central Limit Theorem Demo

***

#### Recently learnt of the Central Limit Theorem and want to see it in action?

#### You can choose the starting distribution and the sample size. The app will then generate the appropriate samples, calculate the sample means, and plot them.

The app is available here: [https://ngthu003.shinyapps.io/App_CLT_Demo/](https://ngthu003.shinyapps.io/App_CLT_Demo/).

***

This app lets the users experience the Central Limit Theorem.
The users can choose from a few starting distributions and a sample size.

The app will then generate an appropriate sample based on users' choices.
The app provides a few plots.

1.  1st tab: plot to show values from a single sample.
2.  2nd tab: plot to show the sample means, and illustrates the CLT.
3.  3rd tab: plot to show other sample statistics for comparison.
4.  4th tab: table to display the data with options to download the data.
