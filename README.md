## Central Limit Theorem Demo

***

#### Recently learnt of the Central Limit Theorem and want to see it in action?

This app lets you play around with the Central Limit Thoeorem.
You can choose a starting distribution and a sample size. 
The app will then generate the appropriate samples, calculate the sample means, and plot them.

The app has 2 versions. Version 1 is the base, and version 2 is an extension with additional functionality and better UI.

*  Version 1: [https://ngthu003.shinyapps.io/App_CLT_Demo/](https://ngthu003.shinyapps.io/App_CLT_Demo/)
*  Version 2: [https://ngthu003.shinyapps.io/App_CLT_Demo_v2/](https://ngthu003.shinyapps.io/App_CLT_Demo_v2/)

#### New in version 2

1.  Improved UI and clearer introductory texts
2.  `Update` button to control when the app updates
3.  `Learn about the CLT` tab with an embeded video explaining the CLT
4.  `Apply the CLT` tab to let the user apply the CLT

This app lets the users experience the Central Limit Theorem.
The users can choose from a few starting distributions and a sample size.

The app will then generate an appropriate sample based on users' choices.
The app provides a few plots.

1.  1st tab: plot to show values from a single sample.
2.  2nd tab: plot to show the sample means, and illustrates the CLT.
3.  3rd tab: plot to show other sample statistics for comparison.
4.  4th tab: table to display the data with options to download the data.
